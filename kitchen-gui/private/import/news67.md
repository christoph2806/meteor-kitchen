### React (experimental)
- Still under development, but now you can generate (very simple) Meteor+React app (for example, try to build `example-minimal` and `example-accounts` applications).
This is how:
```
meteor-kitchen <input_file_or_url> <output_directory> --meteor-release 1.3-rc.11 --react
```
