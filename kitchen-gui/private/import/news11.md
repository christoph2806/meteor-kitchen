- GUI: fixed **many bugs**
- GUI: added possibility to delete object from array (that was somehow missing)
- Added new component type "custom_component" with possibility to provide custom HTML and JS code. Component of type "custom" is deprecated now (still working for backward compatibility).
- Changed how plugins work
