- Looks like I am close to 1.0 but I am not: Next version will be 0.9.10 :)
- There was bug preventing user to change own profile. Fixed now. Check <a href="http://example-accounts.meteorfarm.com" target="_blank">example-accounts</a>.
- Built-in "form" component will show error (if any occurs) while writing data
- "page" object now have "back_route" property and if you set this, button with left arrow will appear just before page title
- "component" and "page" objects now have "title_icon_class" property, so you can add for example "fa fa-home" and that will appear before page title
