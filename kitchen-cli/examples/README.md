Meteor Kitchen Examples
=======================

This repository contains examples for the <a href="http://www.meteorkitchen.com" target="_blank">meteor-kitchen</a> source code generator for <a href="http://www.meteor.com" target="_blank">Meteor.js</a>.

Each example is given both in **JSON** and **YAML** formats.

Meteor-kitchen natively supports input files written in **JSON**. To use the **YAML** example you'll need to have <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/yaml-js" target="_blank">js-yaml</a> converter installed. The following is the most common example of how to accomplish this:

    npm install -g js-yaml
