			About

		<p>
			Meteor Kitchen was started by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/petar-korponai%25C4%2587-3253604a" target="_blank">Petar KorponaiÄ‡</a> as a personal hobby project in 2013 while Meteor was 0.5 beta. Meteor changed a lot since then, and it was almost a nightmare to keep the code generator up to date. However, somehow Meteor Kitchen survived all the "earthquakes" and today we have both CLI and GUI with <a href="{{pathFor 'developers'}}" target="_blank">
					<span class="{{userCountDisplayClass}}">
						{{#if gotUserCount}}
							{{userCount}}
						{{/if}}
					</span>
					registered users
				</a>.

        	Since July 2017, we have grown to a 5 member team and our goal is to make this project rock.
        	<br />
        	<br />
