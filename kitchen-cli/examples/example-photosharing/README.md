Photosharing
============

This is example application built with meteor-kitchen GUI.

Live example is <a href="http://example-photosharing.meteorfarm.com" target="_blank">here</a>.
See <a href="//www.youtube.com/embed/7zWBhtE72o4" target="_blank">video tutorial</a>.

To build and run example, inside this directory type:

```
meteor-kitchen ./example-photosharing.json ./example-photosharing
cd ./example-photosharing
meteor
```

**JSON** and **YAML** files are the same example in different formats.

Meteor-kitchen natively supports input files written in **JSON**. To use the **YAML** example you'll need to have <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/yaml-js" target="_blank">js-yaml</a> converter installed. The following is the most common example of how to accomplish this:

```
npm install -g js-yaml
```
