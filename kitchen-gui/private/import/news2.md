- Added **datepicker input** control into Form component. You need to set `"type": "date"` and `"input": "datepicker"` into field definition.
- Added **export to CSV/TSV/JSON** button into DataView component. You need to set `"exportable": true` into field definitions. Clicking "Export" button will download data currently shown in DataView with fields marked as "exportable". Download is done client side using URI download and HTML5 download attribute (I didn't tested with IE, but I guess it doesn't work).
